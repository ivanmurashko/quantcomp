\section{Composite Systems}
\label{sec:add:quantum:composite}
Systems consisting of multiple parts behave fundamentally differently in the cases of classical and quantum systems.

As an example, consider a system of two particles. The position of the first is described by 3 coordinates, which represent a point in some linear space $L_1$: $(x_1, y_1, z_1) \in L_1$. For the second, let's assume we have 2 coordinates in space $L_2$ completely determining the position:  
$(x_2, y_2) \in L_2$. It is obvious that to fully describe the position of the two particles, we need 5 coordinates: $(x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2) \in L_1 \times L_2$. Thus, composite systems, in the classical case, are described by points in space $L^{classical}$, which is the Cartesian product of the original spaces: $L = L_1 \times L_2$. A distinctive feature of the Cartesian product is that the dimensions of the corresponding spaces add up:
\[
\dim{L^{classical}} = \dim{L_1} + \dim{L_2}.
\] 

In the quantum case, a composite system is described by vectors (points) in a space that is the tensor product of the original spaces: 
\[
L^{quantum} = L_1 \otimes L_2.
\]
In this space, there are 6 basis vectors, and consequently, 6 numbers are required to describe the position of the system:
$(x_1 \cdot x_2, y_1 \cdot x_2, z_1 \cdot x_2, 
x_1 \cdot y_2, y_1 \cdot y_2, z_1 \cdot y_2) \in L^{quantum}$. 
Accordingly, the dimensions multiply:
\[
\dim{L^{quantum}} = \dim{L_1} \cdot \dim{L_2}.
\] 

Thus, if we have two independent quantum systems with wave functions $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$, the composite system will have the following wave function
\[
\ket{\psi_{12}} = \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2},
\]
and obviously the following equalities hold
\begin{eqnarray}
\ket{\psi_1} = Sp_2 \ket{\psi_{12}}, \\
\nonumber
\ket{\psi_2} = Sp_1 \ket{\psi_{12}} 
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., to obtain the state of subsystem 1, one must take the trace over the states of system 2 from the total wave function.

Composite systems have an interesting property where even though the parts of this system represent mixed states, the whole system is pure. As an example, consider so-called entangled states \index{entangled states}:
\[
\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{0_1}\ket{1_2} - \ket{1_1}\ket{0_2}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
which is pure. For the first particle, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_1 = Sp_2 \ket{\psi} \otimes \bra{\psi} = 
\nonumber \\
=
\bra{0_2}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\ket{0_2} + 
\bra{1_2}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\ket{1_2} = 
\nonumber \\
= \frac{\ket{1_1}\bra{1_1} + 
\ket{0_1}\bra{0_1}}{2}
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., the state of the first particle is mixed.
