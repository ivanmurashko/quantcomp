\caption{Elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 -7 x + 10$ over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Addition of two points $p(1,2)$ and $q(3,4)$. The line passing through these points intersects the curve at a third point $r'(-3,-2)$. The point symmetric to $r'$ with respect to the curve, $r(-3,2)$, is the sum of the original two: $p + q = r$}
